## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server, and add the `--open` flag to automatically open the local test. You can also navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` manually. 
The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files while the command is running.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
